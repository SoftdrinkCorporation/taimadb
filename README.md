# Getting started

**Install**
```bash
$ npm install taimadb
```

**Usage**
```js
const taima = require('taimadb')

const db = new taima.Pool({
    host: '',
    user: '',
    password: '',
    port: 3306, // only for MySQL (mariadb is another)
    db: ''
})
db.connect()

db.query('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (id NUMERIC, name TEXT, age NUMERIC)') // both uppercase and lowercase are allowed

// select only works into an asynchronous function.
async function asynchronousCall(){
    let obj = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1')
    console.log(obj[0].name) 
}

asynchronousCall() // -> returning "Murray"
```
